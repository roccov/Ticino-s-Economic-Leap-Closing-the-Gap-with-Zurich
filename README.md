# Ticino’s Economic Leap: Closing the Gap with Zurich

This study analyzes the evolution of economic performance in the Swiss cantons of Ticino and Zurich over the period 2011–2022, focusing on the drivers of Gross Value Added (GVA) per capita. 

Using an extended identity decomposition framework, GVA per capita is broken into labor market components as labor productivity, participation rate, employment rate and average workload, with a specific adjustment for cross-border commuting. 

In addition, a sectoral decomposition of labor productivity is conducted to identify the key industries driving observed changes, with a detailed attribution between sector-level efficiency shocks and inter-sector labor reallocation.


The results reveal a striking convergence between the two cantons: Ticino, traditionally lagging behind Zurich, has significantly narrowed the gap in GVA per capita by 2022.

This catch-up is primarily explained by strong sector-level productivity gains concentrated in a limited number of sectors, which disproportionately contributed to overall growth. 

The findings underscore the importance of targeted sectoral development in regional economic planning and highlight the role of structural composition in shaping long-term economic trajectories.
